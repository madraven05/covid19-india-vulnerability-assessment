## :pencil: Introduction 
> This is our project submission for the course CS328: Introduction to Data Science offered at IIT Gandhinagar, India. 

In this project, we attempt to draw useful inferences from the available compiled datasets by performing EDA, clustering and other important techniques. We also aim to assign vulnerablity scores to states and Inter-state rail networks.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Datasets
We worked with 4 types of dataset:
1. Demographics Dataset
1. Vaccination Dataset
1. Health Infrastructure Dataset
1. Indian Railway Network Dataset
1. Case Counts Dataset
> All datasets available in the [Datasets](Datasets) folder.

## :bar_chart: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We performed EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis on the datasets that we had gathered. This was done to understand the datasets better. Using the analysis, we came to understand the important features that we can consider for the calculation of the vulnerability metrics.

### 1. Percentage of population vaccinated

### 2. Ratio of Total Hospital Beds and Active cases

### 3. Correlation Matrix (Demographics Data)
Features from the demographics dataset correlating well with the number of active cases were chosen 

<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Feature</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Correlation to the Number of Active Cases</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">Marginal workers population (others)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">0.801850</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">Literate population</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">0.761175</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">Number of households</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">0.735023</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">Female Population</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">0.697729</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">Male Population</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">0.691201</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### 4. DBSCAN Clustering
DBSCAN clustering was done on the district-wise demographics and vaccination datasets to gain inferences. We performed PCA on both the datasets to reduce it to **2 dimensions**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>DBSCAN on Vaccination Dataset</td>
<td>DBSCAN on Demographics Dataset<td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p align="center">
<img src="media/vaccplot.png" alt="drawing"/>
</div>
</p></td>
<td><p align="center">
<img src="media/demoplot.png" alt="drawing"/>
</div>
</p></td>
</tr>
<tbody>
</table>

## :mask: Vulnerability Assessment
### 1. State Vulnerability Assessment
This was generated after calculating the *State Vulnerability Scores* for each state of India

</p>
 
### 2. Rail lines Vulnerability Assessment
This was generated after calculating the *Rail Line Vulnerability Scores* for each of the trains in our dataset.

> Equations used for the calculation of the State Vulnerability Score and the Rail line vulnerability score can be found in the [report](DS_Report.pdf)
